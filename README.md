**Course:** Software Testing & Validation
**Project Type:** Midterm Project Assignment
**Date:** November 24, 2025

## 1. Project Description
The **Library Borrowing and Reservation System** is a web-based application designed to manage the circulation of library resources. The system facilitates the interaction between library members and librarians by digitizing core processes such as book searching, borrowing requests, and reservation management.

The primary goal of this project phase is to complete the **Analysis, Design, and Planning** stages to ensure the system is ready for the Testing & Validation phase.

### Key Features:
* **Member Operations:** Book search (Title/Author/Category), real-time availability check, borrowing and reservation requests.
* **Librarian Dashboard:** Approval/Rejection of requests, inventory management.
* **System Validations:** Prevention of double borrowing, automatic due date calculation, and stock status updates.
